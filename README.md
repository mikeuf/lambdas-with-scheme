# Lambdas With Scheme

Scheme is a Lisp-based language that was developed at MIT. It's useful for "functional programming" as opposed to the more-familiar "imperative programming."  

**Note:**  An online Scheme interpreter is available here:

## About Lambdas (λ)
A lambda (λ) is a common notation that is used to define functions, similar to the "f(x)" notation from algebra. It was originally popularized by Alonzo Church who used it to develop [Lambda Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus).

In alegbra, we could define f(x) as:  
f(x) = x + 5  

If we let x = 5, then f(x) = 10.  

We can represent the same function with a λ, leaving us with:  
λx.x + 5  

### Lambdas in Scheme
In Scheme, this can be represented as:  
(lambda (x) (+ x 5))  

If we provide 5 as an input value, we can evaluate this as:  
((lambda (x) (+ x 5))5) ⇒ 10  

Notice that the addition operator ("+") appears before the operands in the list.  

Another example:  
f(x, y) = x² + y²  

Is represented in Scheme as:  
((lambda (x y) (+ (* x x)(* y y)))5 5) ⇒ 50
